- used m1*4 screw
- the RPi 4 screws aren't 100% right, a little off but still works

Well I was going to try and do some gig work but I didn't want to just sit there at a parking lot waiting for hours

So here I am... finally some time off Amazon Prime week is over

Gonna get this project over, I actually want to see how the Pi 4B is as a web browsing computer

I don't have a strong urge to make this. I am thinking about my exploding finances and how I have to work 5x12s soon for 2 weeks.

The extra money will be nice but yeah.

I think in order to make this thing servicable/not a PITA I'll design it in two parts: the bottom which holds the pi then the top which is the trackpad.

The two halves will stack with some screws.

Had a brief break, modeled pi 4b
